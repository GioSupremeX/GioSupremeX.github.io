# Privacy Policy — [BOT_NAME]

Effective date: [EFFECTIVE_DATE]  
Last updated: [LAST_UPDATED_DATE]

This Privacy Policy explains how [OWNER_NAME] ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information about users of [BOT_NAME] (the "Bot").

## 1. Information We Collect
- Discord Profile Data: Username, discriminator, avatar, user ID — provided by the Discord API when you interact with the Bot.
- Guild (Server) Data: Server ID, channel IDs, roles, and server settings relevant to Bot features.
- Command & Interaction Logs: Commands you or moderators use, timestamps, and related metadata required for features and troubleshooting.
- Optional Data: If you provide additional data through commands (e.g., a support ticket message), we may store that content.

We do NOT collect payment information directly (payments are handled by third-party processors where applicable).

## 2. How We Use Information
- Provide and maintain Bot features (commands, settings, moderation).
- Log moderation and audit data for safety and troubleshooting.
- Improve the Bot and analyze usage (may use aggregate analytics).
- Communicate with you about updates, outages, or support requests (via Discord or email if provided).

## 3. Sharing & Third Parties
- We may share data with third-party services required to provide features (hosting providers, analytics, databases, payment processors).
- We do not sell personal data.
- Where required by law or to respond to legal processes, we may disclose data to comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Data Retention
- We retain logs and user data as necessary to provide services and for a reasonable troubleshooting/audit period. Retention durations: [EXPLAIN_RETENTION_PERIODS].
- You can request deletion of your data by contacting [CONTACT_EMAIL]. Deletion requests may be subject to legal or operational constraints.

## 5. Security
- We use reasonable security measures to protect data (e.g., encrypted storage, limited access). No method is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Cookies & Site Tracking
- The Bot itself does not use cookies. This site may use analytics cookies if you add them (e.g., Google Analytics). Specify any third-party trackers here: [THIRD_PARTY_TRACKERS].

## 7. Minors
- The Bot is not intended for users under [MINIMUM_AGE]. If you are a parent/guardian and believe we have collected data about a minor, contact [CONTACT_EMAIL].

## 8. Your Rights
- Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data. Contact [CONTACT_EMAIL] to exercise those rights.

## 9. Changes to this Policy
- We may update the Privacy Policy. The "Last updated" date will change; significant changes will be communicated where feasible.
